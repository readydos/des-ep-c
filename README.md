# The DES Lattice: A Generative Framework for Conceptual Art

## Overview
The DES Lattice is a conceptual system that bridges the gap between historical data encryption and generative art. It focuses on the **"Ghost of Innovation"**—the structures that remain when a primary standard is removed.

## The Framework
1. **Invention**: Create a Symmetric Key (a rigid rule).
2. **Exclusion**: Strip away the primary data, leaving only the "rejected" remnants.
3. **Art**: Focus on the aesthetic of the "Refusés" (the rejects).
4. **Combination**: Merge the void and the structure to create a "Shadow Map."

## Usage
Refer to `des_lattice.c` for the bitwise implementation of the exclusion engine.

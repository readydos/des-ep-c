# The DES Lattice: A Generative Framework for *revealing what is hidden* with visualization.

## Overview
The DES Lattice is a conceptual system that bridges the gap between historical data encryption and generative art. It focuses on the the structures that remain when a primary standard is removed, a "lattice" for seeing what everyone else is ignoring.

## The Framework
1. **Invention**: Create a Symmetric Key (a rigid rule).
2. **Exclusion**: Strip away the primary data, leaving only the "rejected" remnants.
3. **Visualization**: Focus on the aesthetic of the "hidden" (what was excluded from the data).
4. **Combination**: Merge the void and the structure to create a "Shadow Map."

## Usage
Refer to `des_lattice.c` for the bitwise implementation of the exclusion engine.

## Example Application "Kessler-DES"
In this scenario, the Symmetric Key is the "Orbital Standard"—the rigid, mathematical paths that satellites must follow to provide global internet. The Exclusion is the "Space Debris"—the dead satellites, frozen paint flecks, and shrapnel that the standard must ignore to function.
1. **The Invention** (the symmetric key)
  The current "Standard" is a lattice of 5,000+ active satellites. They represent the "1" bits in our 56-bit landscape.
2. **The Exclusion** (*debris/satellites/etc.*)
  We apply the `des_lattice.c` logic to XOR the "Active Standard" against the "Total Object Count." This reveals a 'shadow map': the 130 million pieces of space junk that are moving at 17,500 mph but are "excluded" from the network's mission.
3. **The Result**
  - A "shadow orbit" real-time image, or even `JSON` data that can be used to create dynamic visualizations.
4. If you were ran the DES Lattice Engine on this data, **the output would not be a map of connections**, but a **map of potential collisions**.

Example Output: shadow_map_data.json (Fragment)
```json
{
  "project": "Kessler-DES Landscape",
  "location": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO)",
  "blueprint_type": "Debris Exclusion",
  "data_points": [
    {"id": 9001, "altitude_km": 550.2, "velocity_ms": 7800, "status": "shrapnel_cloud_vanguard_1C"},
    {"id": 9002, "altitude_km": 1200.5, "velocity_ms": 7100, "status": "dead_soviet_reactor_coolant"},
    {"id": 9003, "altitude_km": 400.1, "velocity_ms": 7660, "status": "excluded_paint_fleck_iss_impact"}
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "key_length": 56,
    "system_logic": "XOR Active_Standard vs Orbital_Reality"
  }
}
```
The purpose of the C implementation (`des_lattice.c`) is to provide a "Standard" (rigid, mathematical framework) that can be programmatically XORed against reality to reveal a "shadow map" seen in a visualization.

1. Utilization: a tool for Risk Assessment (practical)
- The C code and the "Kessler-DES" model provide logic for failure-mapping.
- Instead of just tracking what works (the satellites), this system identifies the "shadow map" of what could break them.
  - In high-stakes engineering, **identifying the "exclusion"** (the junk, the gaps, the outliers) is more useful for long term survival than simply monitoring the "standard".

2. A Framework for Generative Visualization/Art (Creative Use)
- A published, licensed methodology (The DES Lattice) that uses exclusion as a creative engine.
- This allows you to generate visual or data-driven work that isn't random, rather - but it is mathematically tethered.
 - You could apply this to any dataset—urban planning, biology, or finance—to reveal its "shadow", as an example.

---
If we apply the DES Lattice to the Kessler-DES dataset, we aren't looking for a map of satellites; we are looking for the interference patterns they leave behind.

In this visualization, the "Symmetric Key" (the active satellite orbits) acts as a stencil. By XORing that stencil against the total orbital reality, we reveal the "Shadow Map"—a ghost-like web of shrapnel, frozen coolant, and paint flecks. It transforms a "network of connection" into a "map of potential collisions."

The Visualization: Shadow Map of LEO

The art generated by this logic typically follows these visual rules:
- **The Voids**: Circular paths where active satellites reside appear as "dark" or empty channels.
- **The Lattice**: High-density clouds of shrapnel (like the `shrapnel_cloud_vanguard_1C`) are rendered as jagged, high-velocity streaks.
- **The Velocity Gradient**: Objects with higher velocity_ms are represented by sharper, thinner lines, while slower "dead" objects (like the `dead_soviet_reactor_coolant`) appear as diffused, glowing orbs.
